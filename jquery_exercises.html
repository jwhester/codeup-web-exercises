<p class="intro">Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient
    Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth
    century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated
    some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time,
    Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings,
    donning costumes and eating treats.</p>

        <p>The early pagan holiday of Samhain involved a lot of ritualistic ceremonies to connect to spirits, as the
            Celts were polytheistic. While there isn't a lot of detail known about these celebrations, many believe the
            Celts celebrated in costume (granted, they were likely as simple as animal hides) as a disguise against
            ghosts, enjoyed special feasts, and made lanterns by hollowing out gourds (hence, the history of
            jack-o'-lanterns). Over time, as Christianity took over and the pagan undertones of the holiday were
            lessened, the basic traditions of the holiday remained a part of pop culture every year, they simply evolved
            and modernized.-->
            The mystical rituals of earlier times evolved into more lighthearted fun and games. For example, the
            somewhat heavy concept of connecting to the dead was replaced with the more lighthearted idea of telling the
            future. Apple bobbing, for example, became popular as a fortune-telling game on All Hallows' Eve: Apples
            would be selected to represent all of a woman's suitors, and the guy—er, apple—she ended up biting into
            would supposedly represent her future husband. In fact, Halloween previously posed a huge (albeit rather
            superstitious) matchmaking opportunity for young women in the 19th century. Another popular All Hallows' Eve
            ritual was mirror-gazing, as people hoped to catch a vision of their future by looking into the mirror.
            There are also reports of fortune-cookie-like favors being given out during earlier times. People wrote
            messages on pieces of paper in milk, and the notes were then folded and placed into walnut shells. The
            shells would then be heated over a fire, causing the milk to brown just enough for the message to mystically
            appear on the paper for the recipient.</p>

        <p>Many people were said to dress up as saints and recite songs or verses from door to door. Children would also
            go from door to door asking for "soul cakes," a treat similar to biscuits. Technical note: Soul Cakes
            originated as part of the All Souls' Day holiday on November 2nd (Yep, a third holiday!), but eventually
            became a part of Halloween night as the concept evolved into trick-or-treating. The candy-grabbing concept
            also became mainstream in the U.S. in the early to mid-1900s, during which families would provide treats to
            children in hopes that they would be immune to any holiday pranks.
            As for the costumes, they evolved too. While they began as earnest tributes to saints, that tradition likely
            fell out of favor at some point…until young Scottish and Irish pranksters got the idea to dress up in
            scary-looking garb again as a way to spook unsuspecting neighbors. And just like that, thanks to these local
            hooligans, Halloween costumes became scary, spooky, funny, and creative all at the same time.</p>

        <p>Halloween obviously remains a popular holiday in America today, but it actually almost didn't make it across
            the Atlantic. The Puritans were disapproving of the holiday's pagan roots, so they didn't take part in the
            celebrations. But once Irish and Scottish immigrants began to arrive in America in greater numbers, the
            holiday made its way back into the zeitgeist. The very first American colonial Halloween celebrations
            featured large public parties to commemorate the upcoming harvest, tell ghost stories, sing, and dance. It's
            estimated that by the early 20th century, Halloween was celebrated across North America by the majority of
            (candy-loving, costume-wearing) people. And this year, once again, we'll all be enjoying our favorite candy
            and admiring our neighbors' decorations on October 31—and the only spooky spirits we'll be talking about are
            the witch and ghost costumes our friends are wearing.</p>
